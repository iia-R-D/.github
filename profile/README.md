Welcome to iia R&D 👋
At iia R&D, we are exploring how AI and software can revolutionize the way researchers, clinicians, and individuals understand and support neurodiversity. Our mission is to develop tools that open new possibilities for studying cognitive diversity—allowing insights and approaches that were previously out of reach.

This initiative brings together researchers, developers, and clinicians to create AI-driven tools that not only study neurodiversity but also provide treatment support. Through self-help tools based on therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), we aim to empower individuals with neurodivergent traits to better manage their mental health.

🙋‍♀️ What We're Working On
Research Tools for Clinicians and Scientists: We develop AI-powered platforms that provide new ways to study neurodiversity, offering insights into cognitive traits and patterns that are challenging to measure with traditional methods.
AI-Assisted Self-Help: Our initiative supports the creation of self-help tools built on evidence-based therapies like CBT and DBT, providing individuals with neurodivergent conditions personalized assistance for managing daily challenges.
Bridging Research and Real-World Solutions: The goal is to not only drive research but also deliver real-world applications—creating solutions that benefit both the scientific community and those living with neurodivergent traits.
🌟 Join the Movement
