iia is an initiative aimed at exploring how AI and software can support researchers, clinicians, and individuals in better understanding and addressing neurodiversity. Our mission is to develop tools that open new possibilities for studying cognitive diversity—providing insights and approaches that were previously out of reach.

This initiative brings together **researchers, developers, and clinicians** to create AI-driven tools that not only study neurodiversity but also provide **treatment support**. Through self-help tools based on evidence-based therapies like **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** and **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)**, we aim to empower individuals with neurodivergent traits to better manage their mental health.

### **🙋‍♀️ What We're Working On**



* **Research Tools for Clinicians and Scientists**: \
We develop AI-powered platforms that provide new ways to study neurodiversity, offering insights into cognitive traits and patterns that are challenging to measure with traditional methods.
* **AI-Assisted Self-Help**: \
Our initiative supports the creation of self-help tools built on evidence-based therapies like CBT and DBT, giving individuals personalized assistance to manage the daily challenges of living with neurodivergent conditions.
* **Bridging Research and Real-World Solutions**: \
Our goal is to not only advance research but also to deliver **real-world applications**—creating solutions that benefit both the scientific community and individuals with neurodivergent traits.
